# AniEel

AniEel is a  program written in python which uses webscraper api
originally created by [BaraniArr](https://github.com/BaraniARR/gogoanimeapi/)(considerably fixed by me) and displays those scraped content along with video through eel
  - __Note__ : The page isn't responsive at this moment and the code isn't readable too.Also,this application simply get links from the web and doesn't host any video on a server. Keep that in mind

## Usage

Download the distributable(.exe) and run it or you can build one for your own os 
by the running following code in terminal in the same directory as this repository
```bash
python -m eel app.py web --onefile --icon=ifyouhaveany
```
